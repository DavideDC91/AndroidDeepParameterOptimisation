        <p>TimeTracker helps you record the amount of time you spend on
        activities; for example, for recording time in a time sheet at work.  It
        provides ways to view, edit, and filter times, and provides a 
        time sheet report as well.</p>

        <h2>The Task view (the main page)</h2>
        <p>The main application view is the task view.  This shows all of the tasks
        and a sum of their times for a selected date range.  This is the main
        view where time is tracked.</p>
        <p>Tasks are added by using the Task view menu's 
            <a href="#add_task">Add Task</a> option.</p>
        <p>To start the timer for a task, tap on the task in the task list.  To
            stop timing, tap it again; or, tap a different task to switch timing to 
            the other task. <em>Two tasks can not be running at the same time.</em>
            </p>
        <p>The <i>Change View</i> menu item can be used to change the range
            of times summed for the tasks.  Options are:
            <ul>
                <li>Today</li>
                <li>Yesterday</li>
                <li>This week</li>
                <li>Last week</li>
                <li>All times</li>
                <li>Select a range</li>
            </ul> 
            Times are filtered by their <em>start</em> date; if a time event 
            crosses a day boundary into a day that is out of the currently 
            selected view range, the <em>entire</em> range will still be included
            in the sum; however, none of that time will appear on the next day,
            so times will only appear once.  
        </p>
        <div style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; background:lightblue; margin: 20px;">
            For example, if the view is set to
            <i>Yesterday</i> and there is a time event that started at 23:00 on
            that day and stops at 01:00 today, then the 2 hours will be included
            in the sum of that task for this view.  If the the view is then
            switched to <i>Today</i> then that time range will not be included 
            in this view.
        </div>
        <p>A report of the times for the week can be displayed using the
            <a href="#report">Report</a> option of the main menu.</p>
        <p>To view a log of the times for a task (for the currently selected view), 
            the <a href="#time_list">Time list</a> option can be selected from the
            context menu (press-hold on a task) of the task.</p>
        <p>Tasks can be deleted using the <a href="#delete_task">Delete task</a>
            context menu item.</p>
        <p>Finally, a task's name can be edited using the <a href="#edit_task">Edit
        task</a> context menu item.</p>

        <h2>The Task view main menu (the menu button)</h2>
        The main task view menu contains the following options:
        <ul>
            <li>Add task</li>
            <li>Change view</li>
            <li>Report</li>
            <li>Help</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a name="add_task">Add task</a></h3>
            This opens a dialog asking for the task name, and adds a new task to 
            the task list.  Cancel this dialog to abort the addition.
            
        <h3><a name="change_view">Change view</a></h3>
            The <i>Change view</i> menu item can be used to change the range
            of times summed for the tasks.  Options are:
            <ul>
                <li>Today</li>
                <li>Yesterday</li>
                <li>This week</li>
                <li>Last week</li>
                <li>All times</li>
                <li>Select a range</li>
            </ul>
            <a name="span_example">Times</a> are filtered by their <em>start</em> 
            date; if a time event crosses a day boundary into a day that is out 
            of the currently 
            selected view range, the <em>entire</em> range will still be included
            in the sum; however, none of that time will appear on the next day,
            so times will only appear once.  
            <div style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; background:lightblue; margin: 20px;">
            For example, if the view is set to
            <i>Yesterday</i> and there is a time event that started at 23:00 on
            that day and stops at 01:00 today, then the 2 hours will be included
            in the sum of that task for this view.  If the the view is then
            switched to <i>Today</i> then that time range will not be included 
            in this view.
            </div>
            
        <h3>Report</h3>
            Opens the <a href="#report">Report view</a>.
            
        <h3>Help</h3>
            Opens a dialog showing the application version and author information,
            as well as a more brief version of this documentation.


        <hr/>
        <h2>The Task view context menu (press-hold on a task)</h2>
        The context menu for each task contains the following options:
        <ul>
            <li>Edit task</li>
            <li>Delete task</li>
            <li>Show times</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Edit task</h3>
            Opens a dialog that can be used to change the name of a task.
        <h3>Delete task</h3>
            Deletes a task, and all of the times for the task.
            <br/><strong>This action can not be undone!</strong><br/>
            A confirmation dialog will be displayed before the task is deleted;
            cancel the confirmation dialog to abort the action.
        <h3>Show times</h3>
            Opens the <a href="#time_list">Time log</a> for the task.
       
       
        <hr/>
        <h2><a name="report">The Report view</a> (weekly sum of all tasks)</h2>
        <p>Use the <i>Report</i> menu item to view a report of the daily time 
        sums per task for an entire week.  The right-most column lists the totals
        per task for the week; the bottom-most row lists the totals of all tasks
        for the day.  Each cell shows the total for a task, for a day.</p>
        <p>The currently running time is included in the display, but is not
        updated in real-time.</p>
        
      
        <hr/>
        <h2><a name="time_list">The Time log</a></h2>
            The Time log displays a detailed list of times for a single task. 
            The list is filtered on the same range view that is currently 
            selected for the main task view; if it is set to <i>Today</i>, then
            only times for today will be shown.
            
            <p>As is the case for the main Task view, if a time range spans days
            that are not in the selected view, then it will be displayed for the
            view on which the time starts.  See the <a href="#span_example">example</a> 
            in the Task view for more information.</p> 


        <hr/>
        <h2>The Time log view main menu (the menu button)</h2>
            The menu for the Time log contains a single entry for adding a new
            time range.
            <p>Use the <i>Add Time</i> option to
            manually insert times into the time log.</p>  
            <p><strong>Note</strong> that TimeTracker will not
            prevent you from creating times that overlap with times in other, or 
            the same, task.</p>
            

        <hr/>
        <h2>The Time log view context menu (press-hold on a time)</h2>
        The Time log context menu contains the following options:
        <ul>
        <li>Edit time</li>
        <li>Delete time</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Edit time</h3>
        This option can be used to adjust the start and end time of a time range.
        This option can also be more simply invoked by clicking on one of the 
        times in the list.
        <h3>Delete time</h3>
        A time can be removed by using this option.  A confirmation dialog gives 
        the user the option of aborting the action.
